# Datupedia

## Introduction
[Datupedia](https://datupedia.com) offers a unique chat interface that revolutionizes how users interact with Wikipedia content. By facilitating natural language conversations with Wikipedia pages, Datupedia enhances the traditional browsing experience, integrating additional context and insights.

## Features
- **Natural Language Chat Interface**: Engage in conversational interactions with Wikipedia pages for an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
- **Enhanced Information Retrieval**: Datupedia doesn't just rely on the primary Wikipedia page. It also incorporates information from pages that reference the searched topic, offering a more comprehensive understanding.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: This advanced feature utilizes the user's query to search through a collection of documents, providing relevant context to the AI model, thus enriching the responses with broader knowledge.

## How It Works
1. **User Query Processing**: The language model enriches the users query by answering without context.
2. **Document Retrieval**: The enriched query is used to retreive K nearest documents.
3. **Context Integration**: These K nearest documents are used as ground context for the returned response.

## Installation and Usage
