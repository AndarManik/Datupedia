Datupedia's system is built upon a concept known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This process involves prompting a language model with a specific set of knowledge. In the case of Datupedia, the knowledge base for each "Datupage" consists of all the paragraphs from Wikipedia that include a link to the page in question.

To organize this information, Datupedia uses a method called hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering sorts data into groups, or 'clusters', based on shared characteristics, creating a tree-like structure of information. This method ensures that information is grouped optimally based on certain criteria, forming the best possible divisions for the data, which in turn define the scope and focus of different sections of an article.

An article on Datupedia is thus generated by sampling these clusters at various levels within the hierarchy. Each section of the article corresponds to one of these clusters, outlining the collective information contained within.

The hierarchical structure also provides flexibility in how the information is presented. Starting with a 'root' article, which gives the broadest overview, by clicking on headers readers can delve deeper into more detailed subsections, each one more focused article that provides a more specific perspective on the topic. This approach allows Datupedia to present layered and nuanced information in a structured and coherent manner.
