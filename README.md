Datupedia is a Wikipedia chat interface which allows users to have a natural chat conversation with a Wikipedia page. This chat goes beyond the traditional Wikipedia page by including information on pages which reference the searched page, improving what the model knows. This knowledge is inserted into the prompt through Retreival Augmented Generation, which uses the users query to search through a collection of documents which are used as context for the model.
