# Datupedia
This is the system implementation for Datupedia.

A Datupage is created through a form of Retreival Augemented Generation (RAG)
Where a language model is prompted using a store of knowledge
The store of knowledge for a Datupage is all the paragraph on wikipedia containing a link to a target page
This knowledge is organized through a heirarchical clustering method
An article is generated by sampling the clusters at different positions in the heirarchy
Given that a clustering is the optimal partition of the elements based on some criteria 
the knowledge is organized into optimial partitions
these partitions are what defines the scope and subject of the article sections
where each section outlines the contents of a single partition
The heiarchical clustering allows for a tree like article 
where each article section can be subdivided and regenerated
In this way the root article is the most general perspective
and by selecting sections more specific perspectives emerge
