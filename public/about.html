        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! Iâ€™m <a href="https://andarmanik.github.io/PersonalWebsite/"target="_blank">Andar Manik</a>, the creator of Datupedia. I'm a web developer
          with a passion for AI and knowledge organization. Fascinated by the
          endless possibilities of combining technology with expansive
          information networks, I embarked on a journey to harness the power of
          AI in making knowledge more accessible and interconnected. Datupedia
          is the fruit of this endeavor, born from a desire to create a platform
          where information is not just consumed but also understood in the
          context of its broader connections. My goal is to provide a unique
          tool for learners, researchers, and the curious, to explore
          information in a way that is both insightful and intuitive.
        </p>

        <h3>My Journey with Datupedia</h3>
        <p>
          The concept of Datupedia was born from a simple yet profound
          realization: the way backlinks frame an idea is as crucial as the
          definition of the idea itself. This mirrors the linguistic principle
          where a word is often defined by its context. Imagine learning a new
          word by seeing it in various texts; similarly, understanding an idea
          through its interconnected references offers a rich, multifaceted
          understanding. This sparked my curiosity about visualizing this web of
          backlinks to offer a deeper grasp of any given topic.
        </p>

        <p>
          My initial assumption was that accessing this backlink information
          would be straightforward, perhaps through a readily available API,
          followed by integrating this data with ChatGPT to craft comprehensive
          articles. However, the journey was filled with unforeseen challenges.
          First, I realized that Wikipedia did not provide a simple method to
          extract text containing specific links, prompting me to develop a
          custom parser. Second, the vast amount of text exceeded the language
          model's context window, leading me to devise an efficient sampling
          method. Finally, the format of the output was more critical than
          anticipated, necessitating a minimal formatting approach and an
          additional parsing stage to ensure clarity and coherence.
        </p>

        <p>
          The final iteration of Datupedia is much more than a web tool; it is
          the embodiment of numerous design decisions and innovative solutions.
          It offers a unique window into the intricate web of backlinks on any
          Wikipedia page, providing users with an enriched perspective. By
          seamlessly blending advanced AI with intuitive design, Datupedia
          stands as a testament to the power of technology in redefining how we
          explore and understand information. It's not just about accessing
          information; it's about experiencing the interconnectedness of
          knowledge in a way that is both insightful and transformative.
